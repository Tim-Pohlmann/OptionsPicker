# Step 6: Spinning Wheel Visualization

## Goals
- Create canvas-based spinning wheel component
- Implement smooth spin animations
- Visual representation of weighted options

## Tasks

### 6.1 Wheel Visualization Component
- Create `SpinningWheel.razor` component
- HTML5 Canvas for wheel rendering
- Calculate option segments based on weights
- Color generation for option segments
- Text rendering on wheel segments

### 6.2 Wheel Rendering Logic
- Draw circular wheel with proportional segments
- Handle text sizing and rotation for readability
- Color scheme that works with many options
- Responsive sizing based on container
- Handle very small segments (minimum size)

### 6.3 Animation System
- Smooth spin animation using CSS transforms or Canvas
- Configurable spin duration and easing
- Realistic deceleration curve
- Pointer/marker indicating selected segment
- Landing animation and highlight

### 6.4 Visualization Interface Implementation
- Implement IVisualizationEngine interface
- Standard methods for triggering selections
- Event callbacks for animation completion
- Configuration options (speed, colors, etc.)

### 6.5 Interactive Features
- Click to spin functionality
- Visual feedback during animation
- Highlight selected option after spin
- Option to skip animation (instant result)

### 6.6 Accessibility
- Screen reader friendly result announcements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode support
- Alternative text-based result display

### 6.7 Performance Optimization
- Efficient canvas redrawing
- Debounce resize events
- Memory management for animations

### 6.8 Testing
- Visual regression tests (if possible)
- Animation timing tests
- Responsive behavior tests
- Accessibility compliance tests

## Definition of Done
- Fully functional spinning wheel visualization
- Smooth animations with realistic physics
- Proper weight representation in segments
- Accessible for all users
- Integrated with selection engine
- Responsive across different screen sizes
- Good performance with many options
