# Step 2: Core Data Models

## Goals
- Implement Option model with full validation
- Create OptionCollection with weighted selection algorithm
- Comprehensive unit tests for selection logic

## Tasks

### 2.1 Enhanced Option Model
- Add validation attributes
- Implement IEquatable<Option>
- Add factory methods for creation
- Handle edge cases (empty names, negative weights)

### 2.2 OptionCollection Implementation
- Implement IOptionCollection interface
- Weighted random selection algorithm
- Add/Remove/Update operations
- Collection validation (duplicate names, etc.)

### 2.3 Selection Algorithm
- Implement weighted selection using cumulative probability
- Handle edge cases (all zero weights, empty collection)
- Ensure fair distribution over multiple selections

### 2.4 Comprehensive Unit Tests
Create test classes:
- `OptionTests` - model validation and equality
- `OptionCollectionTests` - CRUD operations
- `WeightedSelectionTests` - algorithm accuracy and distribution
- Use data-driven tests for multiple scenarios

### 2.5 Performance Considerations
- Benchmark selection algorithm for large collections
- Optimize for repeated selections
- Consider caching cumulative weights

## Definition of Done
- Option model fully implemented and validated
- OptionCollection with working weighted selection
- Selection algorithm tested for fairness and edge cases
- All tests passing with good coverage
- Performance acceptable for 100+ options
